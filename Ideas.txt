Ideas:
-Seat reservation app

-Restaurant admins
-Customer accounts
-Wait lists
-Reserve specific seats
-One restaurant (for now)
-Alert to request review. Or optionally, user can voluntarily enter review after seating time using system to reserve restaurant
-Restauraunts can put up their menu on the app; potential customers can search for restaurants with certain dishes/cuisines
-Restaurants assumed to have same layout (for now; can change later if we have time) nah
-Register restaurant feature (details TBD); owners request admin to register restaurant. They submit image file containing general layout plus accommodation info.
-Owner can upload restaurant info, register admins
-Add /rid=<restaurant id> to end of URL to get restaurant with specific ID
-Accessible seat option? I know we didn't discuss this but it might be something to add to our app if we have the time

Pages required for phase 1:
-Login page
-list of restaurants (can select restaurants from here)
-Restaurant canvas? We can google an image for our mockup
